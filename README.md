Context
We want to set up our smart home in such way that every home appliance we are having can be controlled from our computer. In home that has a smart fan, a smart door, a smart lamp and a smart garden sprinkler. It requires the control of those objects via a computer connected on the same network. These objects are sending their states to the server which will be accessed by the laptop to control those objects based on their states available at the server which are also matching their actual states.

This context has the following elements:

- It has server
- It has a switch
- It has a laptop
- It has a wireless router
- It has a lamp
- It has fan
- It has a door
- It has sprinkler
All the objects (fan, lamp, door, sprinkler) will be connected to the wireless router wirelessly. The router is connected to the switch which also connects it to the server and the laptop using cables (switch, server, router, and laptop use cables).

All objects are registered to the server such that if the laptop connects to the server using its IP address, it lists all objects on a web page in such way that the states of each respective object can be changed using the web page (application).

Make sure that all objects are tested when they are on or off.
